# KtnEm [<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/license/Kirdow/KtnEm?style=flat-square">](https://github.com/Kirdow/KtnEm/blob/master/LICENSE)
Game made using Emscripten using Software Rendering similar to Wolfenstein 3D using C++17. Project is made alongside me learning how to use Emscripten, and is made open source to document my progress.

# Building
Make sure you got Emscripten set up and added to the path. Then run ``build.bat`` or ``build.sh`` depending on platform.

Requires python 3. If any problems arise I'm not responsible.

# Running
If you got VSCode, install Live Server and launch it on ``./dist/index.html``.

If you don't want to run it yourself, a version is available on [My Website](https://ktnuity.com/r3d/), but may be outdated depending on my current progress.
