# KtnEm
Demo project from me learning Emscripten.

Made using C++17.

# Building
Make sure you got Emscripten set up and added to path. Then run ``build.bat`` or ``build.sh`` depending on platform.

Requires python 3.

# Running
If you got VSCode, install Live Server and launch it on ``./dist/index.html``.

If you don't want to run it yourself, a version is available on [My Website](https://ktnuity.com/r3d/)
